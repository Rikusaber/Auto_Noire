5 levels
Level 1: the level being demonstrated in the alpha. HBD receives a visit from DID, asking that he investigate the disappearance of her scientist friend PDH. Upon investigating signs of a struggle in PDH’s apartment, HBD discovers a hidden lab and discovers the existence of a virus that can hijack robots.
Level 2: HBD chooses to tell DID his findings. DID enthusiastically suggests breaking into the facility that is PDH’s place of work to find out what they were using the virus for. They discover it’s being sold to a certain person (name uncertain atm) associated with a gang, but not before being attacked by an infected robot.
Level 3: Continuation from Level 2 in terms of setting. HBD and DID interrogate the robot (who has temporarily returned to their senses) and realize they need to find a way into the gang’s hideout. Still in the facility, they must investigate a newly-opened up area to find a passcode of some sort, but then the main villain (still unnamed) appears with henchmen, reveals DID works for them, and captures them both.
Level 4: Escape from where HBD’s being held, and get to the villain’s hideout. Should be fun, full of puzzles and brainwashed robots. Will hopefully get to learn about villain in the process.
Level 5: Infiltrate villain’s hideout, confront villain and DID, and destroy virus.
